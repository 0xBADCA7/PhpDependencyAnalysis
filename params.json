{"name":"PhpDependencyAnalysis","tagline":"Static code analysis to provide and verify a dependency graph against a defined architecture","body":"PhpDependencyAnalysis\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nPhpDependencyAnalysis is an extendable static code analysis for object-oriented\r\nPHP-Projects to provide [`dependency graphs`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph)\r\nfor abstract datatypes (Classes, Interfaces and Traits) based on [`namespaces`](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php).\r\nDependencies can be aggregated to build graphs for several levels, like Package-Level or Layer-Level.\r\nEach dependency can be verified to your defined architecture.\r\n\r\nRead the [Introduction-Chapter](https://github.com/mamuz/PhpDependencyAnalysis/wiki/1.-Introduction) for further informations.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Providing high customizing level\r\n- Dependency graph creation on customized levels respectively different scopes and layers\r\n- Supports Usage-Graph, Call-Graph and Inheritance-Graph\r\n- Dependencies can be aggregated to a package, a module or a layer\r\n- Detecting cycles and violations between layers in a tiered architecture\r\n- Verifiying dependency graph against a user-defined reference architecture\r\n- Collected Namespaces of dependencies are modifiable to meet custom use cases\r\n- Printing graphs in several formats (HTML, SVG, DOT, JSON)\r\n- Extandable by adding user-defined plugins for collecting and displaying dependencies\r\n- Compatible to PHP7 Features, like [`Return Type Declarations`](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types) and [`Anonymous Classes`](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_classes)\r\n\r\n## [Wiki](https://github.com/mamuz/PhpDependencyAnalysis/wiki)\r\n\r\n1.
