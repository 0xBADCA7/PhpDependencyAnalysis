PhpDependencyAnalysis
=====================

**THIS PROJECT IS IN WIP STATE**

PhpDependencyAnalysis is an extandable static code analysis for
php projects to provide a dependency graph based on php namespaces.
It builds dependency graphs on customizable levels, e.g. on appliaction-, on package- or on script level.
Thus, it's usable to declare dependencies in general, but it's also usable to
detect dependency violations between layers in a tiered architecture according to
compliance with [`SoC`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
[`LoD`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) and
[`Package-Principles`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_principles).
For huge php-projects it's recommend to integrate it to your [`CI`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
to monitor dependencies and violations.

## Installation

For creating graphs [`GraphViz`](http://www.graphviz.org/) is required on your machine, which is
an open source graph visualization software and available for the most platforms.

After installing [`GraphViz`](http://www.graphviz.org/) the recommended way to install
[`mamuz/php-dependency-analysis`](https://packagist.org/packages/mamuz/php-dependency-analysis) is through
[composer](http://getcomposer.org/) by adding dependency to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "mamuz/php-dependency-analysis": "*"
    }
}
```

## Features

- Creating dependency graphs on customized levels or on different scopes
- Detect violations between layers in a tiered architecture
- Graphs can be printed in several formats (HTML, SVG, Graph Script)
- Collecting dependencies and detecting violations are extandable by writing plugins
- Same is true for creating graphs in other formats

## Workflow

PhpDependencyAnalysis uses [`Nikic's Php-Parser`](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/) for parsing
php files. It collects all found namespaces adapted from provided visitor pattern to
resolve dependecies to other packages or libraries.
After that [`clues's Graph`](https://github.com/clue/graph) is used to illustrate dependencies based
on the [`mathematical graph theory`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29).

## Configuration

Create a yaml config and handover is to cli invoker.
