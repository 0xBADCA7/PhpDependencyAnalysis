PhpDependencyAnalysis
=====================

**THIS PROJECT IS IN WIP STATE**

PhpDependencyAnalysis is an extandable static code analysis for
php projects to provide a dependency graph based on php namespaces.
It builds dependency graphs on customizable levels, e.g. on framework-, on package- or on script level.
Thus, it's usable to declare dependencies in general, but it's also usable to
detect violations between layers in a layered architecture, like SoC, LoD and other Package-Principles.
For huge php-projects it's recommend to integrate it to your CI to monitor dependencies and violations.
